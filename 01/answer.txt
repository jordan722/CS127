The code starts with a variable defined as 12, which remains constant.
The variable i is then defined, which changes throughout the code

When the while loop is started, it checks to see if i is less than
the number 12. If it is, the code continues to the if statement.

The if statement checks if our constant variable "number", which is 12,
is divisible by our changing variable i. If it is divisible, it prints
the current value of the changing variable i.

When it completes the if statement, the value of i is incremented by 1,
regardless of the result of the if statement.

This process loops until the value of i becomes equal to our 'number'
variable, which is 12.

All in all, the program will end up printing out all the factors
of the number variable, not including the number itself and 1.

In this example, it will print out 2, 3, 4, and 6
